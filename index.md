Under the Add popup (usually called by Shift-A), at the bottom of the Mesh category.

|***How to use***|
|----------------|
|Draw strokes at the surface of objects or in empty space by either clicking multiple times, or by click-and-drag. When finished (Esc\Enter), the strokes will be converted to mesh edges. When used in Object mode it creates a new separate object. When used in Edit mode the lines are added to the active mesh.|

An option in the Addon panel lets you choose whether or not the resulting model should be in X-Ray mode (in front of other models.)
